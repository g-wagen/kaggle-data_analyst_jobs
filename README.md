# Kaggle: Data Analyst Jobs

## What's this about?
The aim is to take this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs) and try to find answers to these questions:

1. Where do Analysts earn the most/least?
2. How big are the salary differences between Junior, Regular and Senior positions?
3. Are company size and salary correlated?
4. What are the best jobs by salary and company rating?
5. What are the top skills needed for the job?

This is currently work-in-progress.

## How is this going to happen?

### Data Cleanup 
The data has to be cleaned up before any questions can be answered. This step is done.

### Answering the questions
After the cleanup I will dig further into the data and try to answer all the questions.
My tools of choice will be Python and Pandas.

It's important to keep in mind that the dataset is rather small and only refers to job postings in the United States of America. It would be interesting to incorporate more data from other countries.
